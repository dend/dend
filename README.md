# Hi, I am Den 👋

I am a **Member of Technical Staff** at [**Anthropic**](https://www.anthropic.com/) who enjoys working on puzzles (technical or otherwise).

A few things that I do:

- ✨ [**Build Model Context Protocol (MCP)**](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) to help the world connect their data and apps to AI systems (see my work GitHub account - [`@localden`](https://github.com/localden)).
- 🎙️ [**Record a podcast**](https://theworkitem.com) where I interview notable folks about their career and lessons learned along the way.
- ☕️ [**Build a massively-adopted open source utility**](https://awake.den.dev/) to keep your Windows machine awake.
- 📕 [**Maintain a list**](https://github.com/dend/awesome-product-management) of resources to help product managers grow.
- 🌳 [**Maintain a directory**](https://blogscroll.com) of personal blogs and websites for folks to discover corners of the internet they haven't seen before.
- 💻 [**Document the inner workings**](https://deck.surf/) of a popular button box.

In the past I've reverse engineered and documented the **[Halo Infinite REST API](https://den.dev/blog/halo-api/)** (you can check out **[OpenSpartan](https://openspartan.com)** and **[Grunt](https://gruntapi.com)**), **[Zune REST API](https://den.dev/blog/zune-api/)**, and the **[Xbox media API](https://den.dev/blog/xbox-live-download-captures/)**, among others.

You can find me on [**my website**](https://den.dev).
