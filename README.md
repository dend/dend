# Hi, I'm Den 👋

I am an Principal Product Engineer with a deep passion for solving tough problems and technical puzzles.

A few things that I do, from which you might've heard my name before:

- ✨ [**Build and help grow dev tools**](https://github.com/features/copilot) that make engineers more productive (see my work on my Microsoft-linked GitHub account - [`@localden`](https://github.com/localden)).
- 🎙️ [**Record a podcast**](https://theworkitem.com) where I interview notable folks about their career journeys and hard lessons learned along the way.
- ☕️ [**Build a massively-adopted open source utility**](https://awake.den.dev/) to keep your Windows machine awake.
- 📕 [**Maintain a list**](https://github.com/dend/awesome-product-management) of resources to help product managers grow.
- 🌳 [**Maintain a directory**](https://blogscroll.com) of personal blogs and websites for folks to discover corners of the internet they haven't seen before.
- 💻 [**Reverse-engineered**](https://deck.surf/) a popular button box.
- 🪐 [**Built a bunch of Halo-related tools**](https://openspartan.com/) that made it easier to analyze my in-game performance.

In the past I've reverse engineered and documented the **[Halo Infinite REST API](https://den.dev/blog/halo-api/)** (you can check out **[OpenSpartan](https://openspartan.com)** and **[Grunt](https://gruntapi.com)**), **[Zune REST API](https://den.dev/blog/zune-api/)**, and the **[Xbox media API](https://den.dev/blog/xbox-live-download-captures/)**, among others.
